# IdealVLEcalc

This is a simple Vapor-Liquid equilibrium calculator in the ideal state.

It uses Raoult's law and Antoine's Vapor Pressure equation and coefficients to calculate a binary systems Dew and Bubble points.  It's designed to generate interactive graphs for both constant Temperature and constant Pressure systems.

The equations and Antoine's coefficients are taken from the book _Introduction to Thermodynamics in Chemical Engineering_ by J.M. Smith, H.C. Van Ness and M.M. Abbott, 6th edition.

To learn more about the topic, please look for the book or look for the wikipedia articles on:

 * Vapor Liquid Equilibrium
 * Raoult's Law
 * Antoine's Equation

Please note, the x and y functions in the "RaoultFunctions binary.R" file are still untested.
